The OONI logo consists of the Octopus icon and wordmark, as shown.

In situations that call for a monochrome logo, the canonical blue and pure
black are acceptable. However, it is preferable to use the standard multi-color
version of the logo when possible. Avoid using the logo in monochrome light
blue or other colors apart the canonical blue.
